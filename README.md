# Welcome 

## Project info
I have developed a chat application that is currently 50% functional, designed for deployment within private cloud systems. Many companies are hesitant to use standard chat applications due to significant privacy concerns. Since organizations often maintain private cloud infrastructures to safeguard sensitive data, this application can be implemented locally, enabling secure internal communication among their personnel.
